## Booklook / Race-Reading

***

### What you need to now
So if you want to fall down my little rabbit hole you can read the thing under the other titles. If not just read here:)
So that's just a simple search engine for books. The Advantage is you can see the book cover while searching, but I'm gonna be honest I was too late and had too little skill to do something really cool.
So enjoy my little application. That is hopefully the start to some better ones. Thanks :-)

### The Idea Orginal

Since the practice of a Friend and me, reading books at the sametime and then switching out the book. It's our tradition to share the progress in pages and calculate who needs to read quicker for us to finish the books at the same time. For this purpose I wanted to Design a Website that does the job for us. This could be especially practical for people that see themself not everyday.

### Current Point of Progress

#### Why the early Export
Due to this Progress also being done for High Seas from High Club and the Campaign is Ending in short, I've cutted almost everything of the features and exported an experimental version. :-)
#### What's in that version?
Me trying to Integrate the Open Library in my Website. This means we got a search bar where you can search every book of that library and then reach that by clicking on the autocomplete.
#### What Problems does it have / what is missing
First of all, that was my first Web Development Project. For that, I needed to teach myself all of that in 5 hours. I'm actually somewhere fine with the result.
* Could look better
* Takes some to to load
* No Result page
* Some data from open library is just wrong
* And a lot of more stuff is missing

### Lecture for me
Next Year start earlyer and lern web development over the year.
For this Project I will try to work on it as much as possible. But due to school stuff I don't have that much time. So I'll see when that's finished. ):

**More Comming Soon**
##### i hope
